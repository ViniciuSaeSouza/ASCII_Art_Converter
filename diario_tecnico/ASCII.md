American Standard Code for Information Interchange.

**ASCII**, stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It is a [7-bit](https://www.ascii-code.com/glossary/7-bit) character code where each individual bit represents a unique character. This page shows the [extended ASCII](https://www.ascii-code.com/glossary/extended-ascii) table which is **based on the Windows-1252** character set which is an [8 bit](https://www.ascii-code.com/glossary/8-bit) ASCII table with 256 characters and symbols. It includes all ASCII codes from standard ASCII, and it is a superset of [ISO 8859-1](https://www.ascii-code.com/ISO-8859-1) in terms of printable characters. In the range 128 to 159 (hex 80 to 9F), ISO/IEC 8859-1 has invisible control characters, while Windows-1252 has writable characters. Windows-1252 is probably the most-used 8-bit character encoding in the world.
